- ### Domain
Domain is the model that we will focus on to design Hexagonal Architecture.

- ### Ports
Ports is the bridge between business logic and external components

        -   Input:Input ports are used by external components
        -  Output: Output ports are used by databases, or  other output components
 
- ### Service
Service is the  bridge between Input and Output Ports

- ### Adapters
       - Input Adapters:These are the changes that occur on the application with the requests coming to the application.
